SOQL Syntax - 

SELECT fields FROM Object 
WHERE Condition 
Ordering LIMIT 
FOR VIEW Or FOR REFERENCE 
OFFSET UPDATE VIEWSTAT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Generic constituents of an SOQL Query 
    SELECT fields FROM Object WHERE Condition Ordering LIMIT FOR VIEW Or FOR REFERENCE OFFSET UPDATE VIEWSTAT

2 - SOQL Reserved Keywords are
    AND, ASC, DESC, EXCLUDES, FIRST, FROM, GROUP, HAVING, IN, INCLUDES, LAST, LIKE, LIMIT, NOT, NULL, NULLS, OR, SELECT, WHERE, and WITH

3 - Example of Alias
    SELECT Acct.Id, Acct.Name FROM Account Acct

    Querying and filtering by the parent record name using alias - 
    select firstname, lastname from contact con, con.Account acct where acct.name = 'Cloudbyz'

    Querying and filtering by the parent record name using relationship query  - 
    select firstname, lastname, Account.Name from contact where Account.Name = 'Cloudbyz'


4 - Conditional Clauses 
    
    Where Clause - 
    SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Contact WHERE FirstName != null

    Comparision Operators - 
    = Equals ,!= Not equals ,< Less than ,<= Less than or equal to ,> Greater than ,>= Greater than or equal to ,LIKE Like
    =, !=, <, >, <=, >=, LIKE - Different Operators

    Example of Like Operator
    SELECT Name, Amount FROM Opportunity WHERE Name LIKE 'Test%' // '%' is mandatory and without that it wont match any data
    -TIP - %Test% To query with any name that includes test in it.( either at the start or at the end of  string )

    IN operator
    select firstname, lastname from contact where firstname IN ('Shravan','Carol','Rose')

    NOT IN Operator
    select firstname, lastname from contact where firstname NOT IN ('Shravan','Carol','Rose')

    AND Operator Example
    SELECT Name, Amount FROM Opportunity where Amount > 1000 AND Amount < 100000

    OR Operator Example
    Select id , name from Account where name = 'Cloudbyz' OR name = 'Naveen'

    Order By Clause
    SELECT Name,Id FROM Opportunity Order By Name Asc
    Sorting in both Asc and Desc
    SELECT Name, Industry FROM Account ORDER By Name ASC, Industry DESC
    Order By is limited to 32 fields 

    Advanced SOQL Statements

5 - Relationship Queries
    Parent To Child Query 
    Standard object
    SELECT Id, Name, (SELECT Id, Name FROM Contacts) FROM Account
    For a custom object is as below
    SELECT Employee_Name__c, (SELECT Id, Name FROM Hobbies__r) FROM Employee__c 
    (Appemd child relationship name with __r)
    (page 49 - SOQL Book To find the relationship name - goto the child and then in the lookup to the parent find the child relationship name - this gives the desired value - https://www.sfdcpoint.com/salesforce/relationship-query-apex-salesforce/ )

    Child to Parent Query
    For a standard object
        Select ID, Account.Name, Account.Id From Case where ID = '5002800000SsHTg'
    For a Custom Object
        Select Id, Candidates__r.Name from Job_Application__c

    
    The INCLUDES and EXCLUDES Operator
    Used to filter data from a field with the datatype Multi Picklist 
    SELECT Employee_Name__c, Skills__c FROM Employee__c WHERE Skills__c INCLUDES ('C', 'C#')
    SELECT Employee_Name__c, Skills__c FROM Employee__c WHERE Skills__c EXCLUDES ('C', 'C#', '')

6 - The Escape Sequences

    Page - 54 , SOQL Book 
    SELECT Id, Name FROM Account where name = 'Isbol\'s Bulk Company' (\ is used to escape ' from the name)

7 - The Date Formats in SOQL   

    YYYY-MM-DD 1999-01-01
    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm 1999-01-01T23:01:01+01:00(OFFSET doesnt seem to work more insight needed)
    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss-hh:mm 1999-01-01T23:01:01-08:00(OFFSET doesnt seem to work more insight needed)
    YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ 1999-01-01T23:01:01Z

SELECT Id, Name, SLAExpirationDate__c,AccountActivationTime__c FROM Account where name = 'Isbol\'s Bulk Company' AND AccountActivationTime__c = 2020-10-16T21:39:00z

http://eltoro.force.com/SoqlFilterByDateDateTimeField -is a good Reference point for more on dates in apex

8 - Date Literals

    YESTERDAY,TODAY etc - Page 57 in SOQL book has more details

9 - Group By RollUp Clause
SELECT City__c, State__c, COUNT(Employee_Name__c) Counts FROM Employee__c GROUP BY ROLLUP(City__c, State__c)
SELECT Id,Phone,Count(Industry) counts FROM Account WHERE pHONE != NULL Group By ROLLUP(Phone, ID)

10 - For Reference Clause
SELECT Id,Industry, LastReferencedDate FROM Account FOR REFERENCE

11 - For View Clause
SELECT Id,Industry, LastViewedDate FROM Account FOR VIEW

12 - Group By Cube Clause
SELECT Count(Id) IdCount, Industry, Grouping(Industry), Type, Grouping(Type) Indus FROM Account group by cube(Industry, Type)
Gives the count of Id's grouped by combinations of Industry and Type

13 - OFFSET Clause
    SELECT Name FROM Account OFFSET 100
    Fetches query starting from 100
    SELECT Name FROM Account OFFSET 100 LIMIT 50
Salesforce.com recommends that we use the ORDER BY clause whenever we use
OFFSET. Using the ORDER BY clause along with OFFSET ensures that the ordering
of the result set is consistent.
OFFSET limit is 2,000 rows
