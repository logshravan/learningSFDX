// Functions in SOQL

1.toLabel -  Organizations with translation workbench enabled can use the toLabel to get translated values
  SELECT Name, toLabel(Industry) FROM Account

2.GROUP BY - 
SELECT City__c, Count(Employee_Name__c) FROM Employee__c GROUP BY City__c
Note -  All the fields other than the count of employee name should be group by.

3.Count Function
Integer count = [SELECT COUNT() FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Agriculture'];
System.debug('count'+count);

4.Count(Field)
List<AggregateResult> accList = [SELECT COUNT(Name) indus,Industry FROM Account WHERE Industry = 'Agriculture' Group By Industry];
System.debug('count'+accList[0].get('indus'));
COUNT_DISTINCT() - used to find the number of distinct non null field values in query criteria

5.MIN() - used to return the minimum value of the x field
SELECT MIN (FIELD_NAME) FROM Object_API_Name
SELECT MIN(Age__c) MinAge, City__c FROM Employee__c GROUP BY City__c

6.MAX() - used to return the maximum value of the x field.
SELECT MAX(Age__c) MaxAge, City__c FROM Employee__c GROUP BY City__c

7.SUM() - The SUM() method is used to find the total of the specified numeric field.
SELECT SUM(Age__c) MaxAge, City__c FROM Employee__c GROUP BY City__c

8.Having Clause - 
Select Count(Id) accID, Industry From Account Group By Industry Having Count(Id) >= 2

List<AggregateResult> accList = [Select Count(Id) accID, Industry From Account Group By Industry Having Count(Id) >= 2];
System.debug('count'+accList[1].get('accID'));
accList[1] - accList[0] consists of all the null values that are grounped hence used accList[1]..

Limitations and Best Practices 

Write SELECT, FROM, WHERE, HAVING, IN, and so on in uppercase.
If we want to use a single quote inside our SOQL statement, we will have to use a
backslash followed by a single quote. This is called as an escape sequence.
Escape sequences in SOQL page 91.

Using ID in SOQL helps in indexing.
Salesforce Record ID via Apex is 18 digit case in-sensitive
Limitations of standard objects outlined in page 80

Indexing a field (indexing improves query performance) in SF - 
Making a field external ID will make the field indexed and we can also reach out to customer support to make a field indexed
